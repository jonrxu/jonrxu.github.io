            <h4>Short Bio</h4>
            <p>I am a junior at the Wharton School pursuing a concurrent master's in computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence and data science. I am particularly interested in the intersection of AI and healthcare/precision medicine, as well as how to make AI more agentic, multimodal, and generalizable.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor Zhi Huang in the Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine at Penn Medicine.</p>
